        Can you believe we've already been together for a month now?

        I can still remember the 
        awkwardness and uncertainty I felt when I first confessed to wanting to be more than friends, which in hindsight,
        was not uncertainty, but rather fear. Fear that you won't think of me the same way again. 
        Fear of losing the sweetest and most wholesome person I have ever met.

        I can still remember the 
        euphoria I felt when you, on February 28 at 10 PM PST, asked me to be more than friends. I thought I was dreaming.
        I thought it was too good to be true.

        I can still remember the 
        many times you asked me what I was thinking, and I said "nothing."

        I never thought about nothing. You know when something catches your eye, like a beautiful piece of artwork, in a way that you can't explain? 
        Other people might not understand or see what you see, but you firmly believe it's there. But it doesn't matter, because it's not a feeling you would try to
        put into words anyway (unless you're a poet), and in any case you selfishly want only yourself to know what that feeling is?
        Each and every time I thought about "nothing", I was thinking about you.
    </p>

        Funny enough, I can't remember when I fell in love with you. Mostly because I didn't fully understand my own feelings, or what it really meant to love someone.
        Was it when I noticed how cute your smile was and immediately realized I will never get tired of seeing it? Or was it when I realized how happy I felt
        whenever I saw you? Maybe it was when I first noticed my heart beating faster whenever I get a text from you. Or maybe it was when I first had the urge to
        give you a warm hug. Or was it not until I realized how much I wanted to kiss you, how much I wanted to be with you, and how much I prioritized doing everything
        in my capacity to make sure you are happy?
    </p>

        I guess back then, I can never be sure. But I am now.
