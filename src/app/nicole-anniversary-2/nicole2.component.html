        Happy 1/2 year anniversary :) Let's celebrate 6 months since I first wondered the question - where half you been all my life?

        Six months later and my love for you has been ever growing. There has never been a day where I didn't feel lucky to have found
        you. 
    </p>

        I can be petty, irritable, defensinve, and annoying sometimes, but somehow you've patiently stayed with me throughout all of that. 
        You've taught me how to openly communicate my thoughts, feelings, and desires, to be patient, and most of all, to become a better 
        person. And you've been with me through all my challenges so far to help me become where I am. And I am extremely grateful for that.
    </p>

        But I don't really need to justify why I love you, right? That's just my logical brain taking over. 
        I feel happy around you. I feel safe, and I feel like I belong, like I have purpose.
        Even when I'm angry, upset, or annoyed, if I follow my feelings, it will always end up with the desire to be with you.
    </p>

        Oh how I wish I could give you a big fat hug right now. Once I figure out how one measures the fatness of a hug, of course.
